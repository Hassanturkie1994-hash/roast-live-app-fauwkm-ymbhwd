It configures two tabs: \"home\" and \"profile\".\n*   **`app/(tabs)/_layout.ios.tsx` (iOS Tab Layout):** This file defines the tab layout for iOS using `expo-router/unstable-native-tabs`. It also configures two tabs: \"home\" and \"profile\".\n*   **`components/FloatingTabBar.tsx`:** This file implements the custom floating tab bar component. It uses `react-native-reanimated` for animations and `expo-blur` for blur effects. It dynamically determines the active tab based on the current pathname.\n*   **`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:** This file implements the home screen, displaying a list of demo cards.\n*   **`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`:** This file implements the profile screen, displaying user information.\n\nThe main difference between the iOS and Android/Web tab layouts is the use of `NativeTabs` for iOS and a custom `FloatingTabBar` for Android/Web.\n\nTo ensure that all screens are correctly linked and accessible, I need to make sure that the `route` properties in the `tabs` array in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` and the `name` properties in `app/(tabs)/_layout.ios.tsx` match the actual file paths of the screens. Also, I need to ensure that the `handleTabPress` function in `components/FloatingTabBar.tsx` correctly navigates to the specified routes.\n\nBased on the file structure and the code, the following routes should be working:\n\n*   `/(tabs)/(home)` - Home screen\n*   `/(tabs)/profile` - Profile screen\n\nIf other screens are not accessible, it's likely that their routes are not correctly configured in the tab layout files or that the `handleTabPress` function is not correctly handling the navigation.\n\nTo proceed, I need to know which screens are not accessible and what their expected routes are.
